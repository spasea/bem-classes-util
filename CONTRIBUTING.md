# Contributer's Guide

Contributions from the community are welcome and here are some guidelines to help you get started.

## Discussion

While not absolutely required, it is encouraged that you first open an issue 
for any bug or feature request. This allows discussion on the proper course of
action to take before coding begins.

## Building

```shell
yarn
yarn build
```

## Changing

Most of the information you need to contribute code changes can [be found here](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/).
In short: fork, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

## Testing

You can run all the tests with `yarn test`.
